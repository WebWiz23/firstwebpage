  In the beginning,Tim created HyperText Markup Language.<br>
  The internet was without form and void,and text was upon the face<br>
  of the monitor and the hands of of Tim were moving over the<br>
   face of the keyboard. And Tim said,<br>
  let there be links;and there were links.<br>
   And Tim saw that the links were good.
  And Tim separated the links from the text.<br>
   Tim called the links Anchors,and the text He
  called Other Stuffs. And the whole thing put <br>
  together was the first web page.</p>
